# RPerf: Accurate Latency Measurement Framework for RDMA üìà

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üéØ Overview

This package provides an accurate benchmarking tool for **RDMA**-based networks, implemented in Rust.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you install RPerf, you must have the following libraries:

- Rust (https://rustup.rs).
- libncurses5-dev
- rdma-core libibverbs1 librdmacm1 libibmad5 libibumad3 librdmacm1 ibverbs-providers rdmacm-utils infiniband-diags libfabric1 ibverbs-utils libibverbs-dev

## üîß Installation

Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mrkatebzadeh/rperf.git
```
Then you can build the package using Cargo:
```sh
cargo build --release
```
If you want to use hugepages:
```sh
cargo build --release --features hugepage
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Hugepages Settings

To configure hugepages for optimal performance, follow these steps:

1. **Run Subnet Manager**
   - Start the subnet manager on one of the nodes:
     ```sh
     /etc/init.d/opensmd start
     ```

2. **Apply Hugepages Configuration on Every Node**
   - Execute the following commands to set hugepages:
     ```sh
     echo 8192 | tee /sys/devices/system/node/node0/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages /sys/devices/system/node/node1/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages > /dev/null
     ```

3. **Verify Configuration**
   - Check that the changes have been applied successfully using:
     ```sh
     cat /sys/devices/system/node/node0/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages
     ```

   > **Note:** These changes are temporary and need to be reapplied after a reboot.

RPerf by default locates a `config.toml` file in the working directory. This file contains test parameters. Change the parameters according to what you desire. See the [example](./example/README.md) for a simple loopback test.

## üèÉ Running Tests
The simplest way to run with default settings, on the server and clients:
```
./target/.../release/rperf
```
Make sure *config.toml* file on each node has the proper values for __is_agent__ and __server_addr__ parameters.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This implementation is a research prototype that shows the feasibility of accurate latency measurement and has been tested on a cluster equipped with _Mellanox MT27700 ConnectX-4_ HCAs and a _Mellanox SX6012_ IB switch. It is NOT production quality code. The technical details can be found [here](https://ease-lab.github.io/ease_website/pubs/RPERF_ISPASS20.pdf).
